  "body": "# Goldmine\r\nThis is Goldmine, a new bot for Discord that keeps things nice and smug.\r\nThis bot is written in Python 3, and uses discord.py and asyncio for performance.\r\n###Warning: Work In Progress!\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n- Commands:\r\n - purge [channel] - Removes all messages sent by this bot in the specified channel.\r\n - Too many more to list.\r\n- Auto-conversation: start a friendly conversation with the bot!\r\n - Mentions work\r\n - You can also initiate it like `goldmine heya there, you awake?` and it triggers auto-conversation.\r\n - Auto-conversations automatically end when the questions stop.\r\n - Auto-conversations apply per-user and per-channel, which means they won't interfere with other stuff - yay!\r\n - Dynamic bot names\r\n- DM conversations: have some fun here :)\r\n- Per-server bot name and command prefix :D\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n###Two-Click (Public Instance)\r\n####This method is extremely easy, but may not offer the best performance and/or reliability. Overall, better.\r\nJust click this link: [Click to add GOLDMINE and CO. to your server](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=239775420470394897&scope=bot&permissions=66321471 \"Click to add GOLDMINE to your server!\"), select a server, click **Done**, and you're all set! Easy as pie :)\r\n\r\nYou might want to set the command prefix and/or bot name for your server. To do so, simply make sure you're a server admin (Manage Server permission), and type: \r\n - `!setprop bot_name MyAwesomeBot` for bot name, replacing **MyAwesomeBot** with your desired name.\r\n - `!setprop command_prefix $` for command prefix, replacing **$** with your desired prefix.\r\n\r\n###Manual (Private Instance)\r\n####This method is more reliable, but harder to set up.\r\nSimply run `python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies of this bot.\r\nNext, you'll need to create a bot account on Discord and get your bot authentication token. Create a new file called `btoken.py` in the same folder as `goldmine.py`, and insert the following:\r\n```python\r\nbot_token = 'INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'\r\n```\r\nReplace INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token. Make sure you keep the quotes, though!\r\n\r\nThen, you'll want to replace the owner with your DiscordTag. To do this, open `properties.py` in a text editor and edit `bot_owner = '160567046642335746'` to match your Discord user ID. Example: 012345678901234567 - make sure you don't leave out any numbers, though. There should be 18.\r\n\r\n####Now simply run `python3 goldmine.py` and your bot is good to go!\r\n",
